Built with Gatsby

## Warning

It is open sourced and free to use, but it won't work as the `gatsby-source-phoenix` plugin is private (just because it is accessing private data of mine, nothing related to a commercial product)

## Roadmap

[ ] All journal entries page
[ ] Add Leisure activity (cinema, see friends, )
